                        <p class="mb-0">I have always had an interest in technology after being surrounded by it my entire
                            life. From gameboys, to televisions, the beginning of the internet, the rapid succession of 
                            technological advancement has intrigued me as I have always wondered exactly how technology 
                            works. I enjoy figuring out puzzles, solving math equations, and tinkering with single-board computers.
                            Learning coding languages seemed like it would be a good fit and I hope to advance
                            this skill.

                        <p class="mb-0">I play drums for a church in Lee's Summit and I'm in a technical death metal band 
                            called Withermoth. At home I have two dalmatians with contagious smiles. 
                            In my free time you can find me playing drums, building stuff, tinkering with electronics,
                            spending time with family, or riding my bike. I've always 
                            excelled in math and enjoy learning about new technology.</p>
